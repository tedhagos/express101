# A TL;DR History of ECMAScript

* **Javascript** - Language created for the Netscape Navigator
* **ECMA** (European Computer Manufacturers Association) - standards organization for information and communication systems
* **ECMAScript** - ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. It was created to standardize JavaScript

# JavaScript Limitations (outdated)

* No package manager (link .js via HTML is risky)
* No standard file system library
* Too dynamic / not typesafe

# Typescript

* TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft
* It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language
* Needs to be *transpiled* before it can run in the browser (or by NodeJS)

# NodeJS

* JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser
* Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting

# NPM
Package manager for the JavaScript programming language
